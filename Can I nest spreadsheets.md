Can I nest spreadsheets in spreadsheets? Like YAML and json does.

It is not possible to nest spreadsheets within spreadsheets in the same way that you can nest data within YAML or JSON files. Spreadsheets are a way to organize and store data in a tabular format, with rows and columns. You can use formulas and functions within a spreadsheet to link and reference data from other cells, but you cannot create a nested structure like you can with a file format like YAML or JSON.

Than, what tool can I use?

If you want to create a nested data structure, you can use a file format like YAML or JSON. These formats are designed for storing and organizing complex data, and they support nested structures. To work with these file formats, you can use a text editor or a specialized tool like a YAML or JSON editor. These tools can help you create, edit, and validate the syntax of your data files.

YAML or JSON is good for saving and transfering data. But when it comes to writing new data, it's so cumbersome, because it makes me repeat specifing all the properties in every objects!

You are correct that YAML and JSON can be cumbersome to work with if you need to write a lot of data by hand. These file formats are designed for storing and organizing data, not for creating new data from scratch. If you need to write a lot of data, you may want to use a different tool or approach.

One option is to use a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. These tools allow you to create and edit tabular data in a graphical interface, which can be faster and easier than writing data by hand in a text editor. You can also use formulas and functions to automate data entry and calculation, which can save time and reduce errors.

Another option is to use a database management system (DBMS) to store and manage your data. A DBMS is a specialized tool that is designed for working with large amounts of structured data. You can use a DBMS to create tables, define the structure of your data, and write SQL queries to insert, update, and retrieve data. This approach can be more efficient and flexible than using a file format like YAML or JSON, especially if you have a lot of data to work with.

But, as you said, a spreadsheet program cannot handle nested structure.

That's correct. Spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets are not designed to handle nested data structures. These programs are best suited for working with tabular data, where each cell in the spreadsheet represents a single value. They do not support the kind of nested, hierarchical data structures that you can create with YAML or JSON.

If you need to work with nested data structures, you can use a database management system (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet program. A DBMS is a specialized tool that is designed for storing and managing structured data. You can use a DBMS to create tables and define the structure of your data, including any nested relationships between different data elements. This can be a more powerful and flexible approach than using a spreadsheet, especially if you have complex data that needs to be organized in a hierarchical structure.

You can also consider using a file format like YAML or JSON, along with a text editor or specialized tool like a YAML or JSON editor. These tools can help you create, edit, and validate your data files, and they support nested data structures. This approach can be useful if you need to share your data with other applications or systems, or if you need to store your data in a format that can be easily transported and accessed.

Is DBMS is a program like Excel? Or it is a file format like YAML?

A database management system (DBMS) is not a file format like YAML or JSON, nor is it a program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. A DBMS is a specialized tool that is designed for storing and managing large amounts of structured data.

A DBMS typically consists of several components, including a database engine, a data storage system, and a query language. The database engine is the core component of the DBMS, and it is responsible for storing, organizing, and managing the data in the database. The data storage system is where the data is actually stored, and it can be implemented using a variety of technologies, such as disk storage or memory-based storage. The query language is a set of commands and syntax that users can use to interact with the database, such as inserting, updating, or querying data.

In contrast, a file format like YAML or JSON is a standardized way of encoding and storing data in a text-based format. These file formats are designed for representing complex data structures in a human-readable way, and they can be used to exchange data between different applications or systems. A program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, on the other hand, is a graphical tool for creating and editing tabular data.

Overall, a DBMS is a more powerful and flexible tool for working with structured data than a file format like YAML or JSON, or a spreadsheet program like Excel or Sheets. It provides a robust and scalable solution for storing, organizing, and querying data, and it is widely used in a variety of applications and industries.

Ok. Where can I start with DBMS?

If you are new to database management systems (DBMS), there are several resources and tutorials available online that can help you get started.

To begin with, you should familiarize yourself with the basics of database design and the different types of databases that are available. This will help you understand the concepts and terminology that are used in the field of database management, and it will give you a foundation for working with DBMS.

Next, you should choose a DBMS to work with. There are many different DBMS products available, and each one has its own features, capabilities, and limitations. Some popular DBMS products include MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL. You can research these products and compare their features and pricing to find the one that is right for your needs.

Once you have chosen a DBMS, you can start learning how to use it. Many DBMS products have tutorials, documentation, and other resources available on their websites that can help you get started. You can also find a variety of online courses, tutorials, and books that can teach you how to use a specific DBMS product. These resources can provide step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and using the DBMS, as well as tips and best practices for working with databases.

Overall, the best way to learn about DBMS is to start exploring and experimenting with different products and tools. As you gain more experience and knowledge, you can continue to learn more advanced concepts and techniques for working with databases.

Can you pick one for a beginner?

There are many different database management systems (DBMS) available, and it can be difficult to choose the right one for a beginner. However, some popular DBMS products that are well-suited for beginners include MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server.

MySQL is a widely-used open-source DBMS that is known for its simplicity and ease of use. It has a large community of users and developers, and there are many resources available online that can help you learn how to use it. MySQL is a good choice for beginners because it has a straightforward interface and a large number of tutorials and documentation available to help you get started.

Microsoft SQL Server is another popular DBMS that is well-suited for beginners. It is a commercial product that is developed and supported by Microsoft, and it offers a wide range of features and tools for working with databases. Microsoft SQL Server has a graphical interface that makes it easy to use, and it has a large number of tutorials and other resources available to help you get started.

Overall, the best DBMS for a beginner will depend on your specific needs and preferences. You should research different DBMS products and compare their features, pricing, and support options to find the one that is right for you. It is also a good idea to start with a simple and easy-to-use DBMS like MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server, and then move on to more advanced products as you gain more experience and knowledge.
