Rename Kimjung.
2 / 2

Kimjung could be renamed to Democratic Republic of Seoul – named after its capital city and its governing ideology of democracy.

Make one more country in Korean Peninsula in 2021. This time, don't use a place name in it's name. You can add some fantasy-like things.
2 / 2

The Republic of Jangseong – a republic that is known for its advanced technology and powerful military. The name Jangseong comes from the mythical creature that is said to protect the country from harm.
2 / 2

Good. List up 6 countries you made.

    Democratic Republic of Kimjung
    Socialist Republic of Haeju
    Capitalist Republic of Seongnam
    Communal Republic of Gaeseong
    Monarchist Kingdom of Gyeongju
    Republic of Jangseong


Did you forgot that we renamed Kimjung one?

Yes, I forgot to include the renamed version of Kimjung, which is:

    Democratic Republic of Seoul


Ok. Apply that change. Now, make YAML file that includes the countries' information like capital city, population, governing ideaology. Make sure to put it on code block.
2 / 2

Here is the YAML file with the countries' information:

countries:
  - name: Democratic Republic of Kimjung
    capital: Seoul
    population: 25 million
    ideology: democracy
  - name: Socialist Republic of Haeju
    capital: Haeju

Jangsung is not a city but the mystical creature. Change the capital city of Republic of Jangseong to a real city. The city should be somewhere in Gangwon.

Here is the updated YAML file with the correct capital city for the Republic of Jangseong:

countries:
  - name: Democratic Republic of Kimjung
    capital: Seoul
    population: 25 million

Divide Democratic Republic of Kimjung to two different country. Also devide Seoul to North and South, so that the two countries have each one as their capital. Give the two countries unique name without using "Seoul", "Kimjung", "Democracy" and "Republic". The name should be subtly cyberfunkish.

What does nexo mean?
2 / 2

Nexo is a word that comes from the Latin word "nexus" which means "a connection" or "a link". In this context, the name Nexo Republic could be interpreted as a country that is connected and linked to the world through its advanced technology and cyberfunkish culture.

Can you suggest me some cyberfunkish or fantagy-like ideology for Nexo Republic and Cyberspace Republic?

Sure, here are some possible cyberfunkish or fantasy-like ideologies for the Nexo Republic and Cyberspace Republic:

    Nexo Republic: Neocommunism – a futuristic form of communism that is based on advanced technology and cybernetic enhancements.
    Cyberspace Republic: Cyberocracy – a government system where the ruling power is held by advanced artificial intelligence and cybernetic beings.
    Nexo Republic: Technocracy – a government system where the ruling power is held by experts in the field of technology and science.
    Cyberspace Republic: Matrixism – a belief system that sees the digital world as the ultimate reality and seeks to merge with it.
    Nexo Republic: Cybergnostic – a religious belief that sees advanced technology as a means to achieve spiritual enlightenment and transcendence.
    Cyberspace Republic: Virtualism – a belief that the digital world is the true reality and that physical existence is just an illusion.


Ok, change Nexo Republic's ideolgy to Neocommunism, and Cyberspace Republic's one to Technocracy.

To make it clear, change North Seoul to North Seoul (Shindo) and South Seoul to South Seoul (Seogye). And give new name for Nexo Republic and Cyberspace Republic, inspired by their capital city and ideology, in a similar format to the others.
