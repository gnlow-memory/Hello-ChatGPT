Imagine a fantasy species. They basically look like humans, but have a pair of wing. They can fly. They migrates every season.

Sure, I can imagine a fantasy species that resembles humans with wings and the ability to fly. They could migrate to different locations in search of food or to avoid harsh weather conditions. Their wings would allow them to travel great distances and navigate through challenging terrain. They might live in large groups or colonies, coming together for protection and to raise their young. It's up to you to decide how their society and culture would develop, but I'm sure it would be fascinating to explore.

Good. Additionally, they are peddler. They fly across the countries with goods! 

That's an interesting addition to the fantasy species. Since they can fly, they would have an advantage over other species when it comes to traveling and trading goods. They could visit different countries and sell a variety of items, from food and clothing to tools and trinkets. They might have a reputation as skilled traders and bargainers, using their knowledge of different cultures and goods to make successful deals. They could also face challenges, such as bad weather or hostile territories, but their ability to fly would give them a unique advantage in overcoming these obstacles.

But, how they will carry the goods? Would they hold it in their arms? Or carry on their back? Or what else? Do you have any idea?

It's up to you to decide how the fantasy species would carry their goods while flying. One option could be for them to use harnesses or packs to hold the goods on their backs, allowing them to use their arms and wings freely. They could also use baskets or other containers attached to their bodies or wings. Alternatively, they could use their wings to create a sort of "airborne train," with each individual carrying a small portion of the goods and flying in formation to distribute the weight evenly. The possibilities are endless, and it's up to you to decide how this fantasy species would transport their goods.

I think it's a good idea. By the way, they don't have a settlement, so they don't have territory, too. Then, how they would build their own country? Will that be even possible? How do you think?

It's possible for a fantasy species without a permanent settlement or territory to build their own country. Since they are able to fly and migrate, they could establish temporary camps or settlements in different locations depending on the season. They could come together to form a government or ruling body that would make decisions on behalf of the group and represent their interests to other countries. They could also establish laws and customs to govern their society and protect their way of life. It might be challenging for them to maintain a cohesive country without a fixed territory, but with determination and cooperation, they could make it work.

Will their neighbor countries allow them to establish temporary camps on their territory?

It's difficult to say whether other countries would allow the fantasy species to establish temporary camps on their territory without knowing more about the context and the relationships between the different groups. It's possible that the other countries might see the fantasy species as a threat and deny them permission to set up camps within their borders. On the other hand, the fantasy species might have established good relations with their neighbors and be able to negotiate a mutually beneficial agreement. Ultimately, the decision would depend on the specific circumstances and the willingness of both sides to find a solution.

I see. Which benefits will the fantasy species be able to give their neighbors?

It's difficult to say exactly what benefits the fantasy species might be able to offer their neighbors without knowing more about their unique abilities and resources. However, since they are skilled traders and able to fly, they might be able to provide access to goods and services that are difficult for other species to obtain. They could also act as intermediaries, facilitating trade and diplomatic relations between different countries. In addition, their ability to fly could be useful in a variety of situations, such as carrying messages or providing aid in times of crisis. These are just a few examples, but there could be many other ways in which the fantasy species could benefit their neighbors.

Good. How about giving a name for the fantasy species?

When it comes to naming a fantasy species, the possibilities are endless. Some names might reflect the species' physical characteristics, such as their wings or their ability to fly. For example, you could choose a name like "Aerians" or "Skyborn." Other names might evoke the species' culture or way of life, such as "Traders" or "Nomads." Ultimately, the choice of name is up to you and should reflect the unique qualities and characteristics of the fantasy species.

Ok. I want to name it "Hahin".

"Hahin" is an interesting name for a fantasy species. It's short and simple, but also distinctive and memorable. It could be the name of a tribe or clan within the species, or the name of the species as a whole. Whichever way you choose to use it, "Hahin" is a strong and evocative name that could work well for your fantasy species.
