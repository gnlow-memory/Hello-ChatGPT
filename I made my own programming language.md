I made my own prgramming language. 


```
// Define match function
match =
    ($ % 15 = 0)    => FizzBuzz
    ($ % 3 = 0)     => Fizz
    ($ % 5 = 0)     => Buzz
    _               => $

// Define fizzBuzz function, which makes a list with a numbers 1 to input value, and maps the list to match function
fizzBuzz = (1~$)..match

// Show results
result1 = fizzBuzz 5    // 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz

// Syntactic sugars
result2 = fizzBuzz(5)   // 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz
result3 = 5.fizzBuzz    // 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz
```

```
fib =
    0 => 1
    1 => 1
    _ => fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)

fibResult1 = 10.fib // 55
```

This looks like a functional programming language that uses pattern matching and syntactic sugars to make the code more readable and concise. The match function takes a number as input and uses pattern matching to return a string based on the value of the number: if the number is divisible by 15, the function returns "FizzBuzz"; if the number is divisible by 3, it returns "Fizz"; if it's divisible by 5, it returns "Buzz", and in any other case it returns the number itself.

The fizzBuzz function takes a range of numbers from 1 to the input value and maps each number to the match function, returning a list of the results. The fib function uses recursive pattern matching to calculate the Fibonacci number for a given input value.

Write parser for the langauge.

Writing a parser for a programming language is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of the language's syntax and semantics. In order to write a parser for this language, we would need to define the language's grammar and syntax rules, and then implement a parser that can interpret and analyze the code according to those rules. This would involve writing functions to tokenize the code, identify and classify the different language elements (such as keywords, operators, and literals), and then use that information to build an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the structure and meaning of the code.

Show me the parse tree of this expression: ($ % 3 = 0) => Fizz

A parse tree is a graphical representation of the syntactic structure of a piece of code, showing the hierarchy and relationship between the different language elements in the code. In order to generate a parse tree for this expression, we would first need to define the language's grammar and syntax rules, and then use those rules to parse the expression and build the tree.

Here is an example of how the parse tree for this expression might look like:

               =>
              /  \
             =    Fizz
            / \
           %   0
          / \
         $   3
         

In this parse tree, the => operator is the root node, with the = operator and the literal Fizz as its children. The = operator has the % operator and the literal 0 as its children, and the % operator has the variable $ and the literal 3 as its children. This tree shows the hierarchical relationship between the different elements in the expression, and can be used to analyze the code and understand its meaning.

Write Antlr4 grammar for this language.

ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a parser generator that can be used to create parsers for a variety of programming languages. In order to write an ANTLR4 grammar for this language, we would need to define the language's syntax and semantics, and then use ANTLR4's syntax and features to specify the rules for recognizing and interpreting the language elements.

Here is an example of how an ANTLR4 grammar for this language might look like:

grammar MyLanguage;

start
    :   expression
    ;

expression
    :   matchExpression
    |   fizzBuzzExpression
    |   fibExpression
    |   assignmentExpression
    |   functionCall
    ;

matchExpression
    :   'match' '=' '(' variable '%' INTEGER '=' INTEGER ')' '=>' IDENTIFIER
        ( '(' ')' | '(' expression (',' expression)* ')' )
        ';'
    ;

fizzBuzzExpression
    :   'fizzBuzz' '=' '(' range ')' '..' 'match' ';'
    ;

fibExpression
    :   'fib' '=' '(' INTEGER ')' '=>' INTEGER
        ( '(' ')' | '(' expression (',' expression)* ')' )
        ';'
    ;

assignmentExpression
    :   IDENTIFIER '=' expression ';'
    ;

functionCall
    :   IDENTIFIER '(' (expression (',' expression)*)? ')' ';'
    ;

range
    :   INTEGER '~' INTEGER
    ;

variable
    :   IDENTIFIER
    |   INTEGER
    ;

IDENTIFIER  :   [a-zA-Z]+ ;
INTEGER     :   [0-9]+ ;
WS          :   [ \t\r\n]+ -> skip ;

This grammar defines the syntax and rules for recognizing the different elements in the language, such as expressions, assignments, function calls, and patterns. It uses a combination of lexer and parser rules to identify and classify the different language elements, and then uses those rules to build an AST that represents the structure and meaning of the code. This grammar can then be used with ANTLR4 to generate a parser that can interpret and analyze code written in this language.
