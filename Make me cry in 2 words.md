Loved ones.

How?

The word "loved ones" can evoke feelings of sadness and loss if the person thinking about it has lost someone they loved. The thought of losing someone we care about can be very emotional and can bring us to tears. It is also common to feel a deep sense of loneliness and isolation when we lose someone we love, which can make us feel like we are all alone in the world. These emotions can be very powerful and can easily bring us to tears.
